# Pancake-Corner

Welcome to one of my first early projects using only HTML+CSS+Bootstrap 5

The project contains 5 HTML pages: Homepage, Login page, Register page, About page, Menu, and a mock cart icon.

The application is responsive on small screens by using responsive bootstrap.

## Functionalities

1. Homepage

- Contains a sticky navbar with all the main pages of the project where the user can go
- Has a `Menu` and `Book` button in the middle-right side of the screen.
- Pressing `Menu` button, will take the user to the Menu page (more details below).

2. Login

   - Will take the user to the Login page where a username and password is prompted to sign in.

3. Register

   - Register page is a form where the user must enter an e-amil address, a password, city, and choose a country from the list, as well as a bullet to choose between male/female.

4. About

   - has the same sticky navbar as the other pages
   - contains a list of horizontal cards which are vertically aligned on the page containing short-stories and brief history of the business
   - the `Footer` section has a contact form where the user can write a message to the business, with mock icons to social media as well as a mock privacy policy, careers, etc.

5. Menu
   - this is a dropdown with the menu options available to the user
   - choosing any category from the list, will take the user to the `Menu` page.
   - Contains a main carousel with 3 main products, followed by 4 more highlighted recipes.
   - There is a also a mock button that is supposed to take to the user to Play Store/Apple store to download the business` application for ordering.
   - the same `Footer` section is found here.
